# FM Codes
Welcome to my first Github repository Formula Manipal. My name is Jithesh Vijay and I am here to share with you 10 basic C codes that I have uploaded to this repository. These codes are my first steps towards understanding the C programming language and how to use it effectively.

The codes in this repository cover basic concepts such as loops, arrays, functions, and more. Each code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for beginners who are just starting out with C programming.

And if you have any feedback or suggestions, I would love to hear from you.

Thank you for visiting my repository.


Sincerely,


Jithesh Vijay
